Classification and quantification of cells in brightfield microscopy images: an application of convolutional neural networks

# Abstract:
Microscopy is crucial in medical research, enabling diverse investigations, including cell quantification. Traditional methods can be time-consuming and prone to errors, often requiring human intervention or automated techniques, mainly applied to fluorescent images. Machine learning has revolutionized microscopy by automating tasks and building predictive models from large datasets. These models excel in object detection, image segmentation, and target classification. Leveraging unstained images to preserve cell integrity, models can learn morphology-based classification, especially challenging with fluorescent markers. Our goal was to create a model for classifying cell lineages in digital contrast microscopy images and quantifying cell numbers. We employed a CNN machine learning algorithm for classification, evaluating it using metrics like confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC Curve. For regression, we used Mean Squared Error (MSE). The model achieved impressive accuracy, reaching 93%, with ROC curve results nearing 1.0, indicating strong performance. However, slightly lower accuracies were observed for SH-SY5Y (78%), HUH7_mayv (85%), and A549 (88%) lineages compared to others. These results highlight the model's quality and the potential of CNNs in handling the intricate complexities of microscopic images. Microscopy, aided by machine learning, holds significant promise in accelerating and enhancing medical research, particularly in cell quantification and lineage classification.
